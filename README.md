# OAuth2

This is my journey on the OAuth2 Spec. I intend to follow Aaron Parecki's book called [OAuth2 Simplified](https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified) which is an amazing book to help describe the terminology in a simplified format.

## Motivation

This GIT repo is my collection of notes as I have worked through the tutorials in this book. In my day job as an *Integration and API Specialist* we are currently designing our new AuthZ and AuthN patterns around the **OAuth2** and **OpenID** specification and this book has been instrumental in learning the OAuth2 spec.
